Working with this team has been so much fun, and I had a blast making some of the art assets for this mod. I'm incredibly grateful to be given the opportunity to work on sprites for this project and from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank everyone who made this little poke-pasta mod possible. Also hi Penkaru."
