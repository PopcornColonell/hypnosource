I'm glad I had the opportunity to come back to this project and work on v2, not only to make a sprite of gf I'm more proud of for lost cause, but to also do some bg work as well. I made the background art for pasta night (the room itself not the characters) and for isotope, both of which I'm very proud of. Hope you all enjoy the update, cause I know for a fact that I and the rest of the team enjoyed working on it."
