Anyways, now that those 2 things are cleared up hello!!! I’m a charter and content creator you may or may not have seen on the Tube… In all seriousness tho, even through all the more difficult times, this mod was still extremely fun to work and I still feel very lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to this :) Big thank you to everyone in the dev team and to YOU!!! FOR PLAYING!!"
