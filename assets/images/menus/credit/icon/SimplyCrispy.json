In total seriousness, working on Hypno was a dream come true for me, it was always one of my top 3 and the only one I didn't actually work on, as such, I was stoked to get to join the team and help this amazing project get to where it is now. Everyone in the dev team is a goat, love them all to death, and working with them, becoming closer to them and just hanging out with them in general was the highlight of it all for me, it's not often you get to see a team feel so cozy and actually genuinely passionate about the product they're producing, and I couldn't ask for better. Love y'all"
