My favorite part of this mod was Brimstone, bringing it together was such a unique experience that involved a lot of us. This team is like a group of friends to me, and working with them has been incredibly fun!\n\nIt's not without its setbacks, but nothing truly is, being able to help direct and collaborate on such a massive project has given me so much experience. Thank you for playing!"
