Sonic EXE mod as well as the voice of Super Sonic (Fleetway), or for my unbridled enthusiasm and obsession with Sonic in general. im responsible for the music of both Lost Cause and Purin and they stand as some of my final contributions to the FNF community before i go back into my cave to fixate on Sonic for the rest of my life, so i hope you enjoyed! its been a pleasure"
